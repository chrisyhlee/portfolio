# Hello there!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio!

This was built using yarn create react-app

I also installed TailwindCSS for the utility-first styling options it provided.

There will always be new features or projects to add as I continue to work on them, but any permanent changes will always be pushed here! Thanks for stopping by!
